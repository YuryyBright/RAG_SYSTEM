# 🔍 Optimal Chunk Size and Embedding Dimension for RAG Systems

## 📈 Chunk Size Recommendations

**Ideal Chunk Size:**

| Document Type | Recommended Chunk Size |
|:--------------|:------------------------|
| Plain Text / Articles | 350–450 tokens |
| Dense Academic Papers | 450–600 tokens |
| FAQs / Short Answers | 250–300 tokens |

**Best Practices:**
- Target **400 tokens** per chunk for a balanced semantic coverage.
- Maintain an **overlap** of **15–20%** (~50–80 tokens) to preserve context between adjacent chunks.
- Prefer **semantic splitting** (e.g., by sentence or paragraph) over raw token slicing.

**Example Settings:**
```json
{
  "chunk_size_tokens": 400,
  "chunk_overlap_tokens": 80
}
```

## 🔄 Embedding Dimension Recommendations

**Based on Embedding Model:**

| Embedding Model | Dimension | Notes |
|:----------------|:----------|:------|
| OpenAI Ada-002 | 1536 | Default, high-quality embeddings |
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | Fast, efficient, new generation |
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | 3072 | Highest quality, higher cost |
| E5-Large / Instructor-XL (Open Source) | 768 | Great for private hosting |
| MiniLM / MPNet | 384 | Lightweight, fast, smaller memory footprint |

**Professional Guidance:**
- Use **1536 dimensions** for most RAG deployments with OpenAI models.
- Choose **768 dimensions** for open-source embeddings (e.g., HuggingFace models).
- Use **384 dimensions** only for resource-constrained environments.

## 💡 Optimized Settings for Production

```json
{
  "chunk_size_tokens": 400,
  "chunk_overlap_tokens": 80,
  "embedding_dimension": 1536
}
```

- Balanced between **retrieval accuracy** and **performance**.
- Ideal for most real-world applications including technical docs, knowledge bases, and customer support systems.

## 🌟 Pro-Tuned Settings for Long Documents

```json
{
  "chunk_size_tokens": 512,
  "chunk_overlap_tokens": 100,
  "embedding_dimension": 3072
}
```

- Useful for **legal**, **medical**, and **scientific** documents with complex structures.
- Requires higher memory and compute resources.

# 📚 Summary Table

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Reason |
|:----------|:------------------|:------|
| Chunk Size | 400 tokens | Preserves semantic meaning, fast retrieval |
| Overlap Size | 80 tokens | Maintains context continuity |
| Embedding Dimension | 1536 | Balances cost and quality |

###            default_chunk_size: int = 1400,  # ✅ ~400 tokens
###            default_chunk_overlap: int = 250,  # ✅ ~20% of chunk size
###            default_separator: str = "\n"  # ✅ Still fine as fallback



> ✨ These settings ensure your RAG system performs with **high semantic retrieval quality**, **low latency**, and **optimized memory usage**.
